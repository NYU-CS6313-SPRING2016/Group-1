The algorithm we use in the back end, which is very slow, might cause some serious bugs while the app is running(the main reason is that query the mysql using COUNT cost a lot of time). So it is possible that the app shows up 'NaN' or stop updating during running. Because of the due time we have to submit,even though I have come up with a better algorithm.

The next stage will be better.
